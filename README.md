# Sum Game
 The final project of the "Digital Circuit" course \
 In this project, I have built the Sum Game using only digital circuits and logical gates (such as AND, OR, XOR, ENCODER, DECODER, ADDER, SHIFTREGISTER, and...). In this game there are two players, each trying to find three numbers of A, B and C which A equals the sum of B and C (A = B + C) in a specific predefined time. By reaching to a specific score the player is anounced as the winner.
